                Today, 3rd of August, I learnt the dynamics of project structuring. In a nutshel, I went through the gritty-nitty of having folders and files well-organized and structured in a local working space. 
                I had wanted to have my own website [not a portfolio perse] where I'd just sit and document whatevr I have learnt at the end of the day. 
                not that there ain't platforms out there where I can document my learning process.
                But, I felt the urge to have my own platform, from scratch, whhere I'd cassually document everything as I learn.
                Developing such a platform would come with numerous benefits:

                    <li>Learning by Building</li>
                    <li>Learning by Telling on the go etc. </li>
                </ol>
